# 1 - Introduction

- the React **Context API** gives us an easy way to share state between components without having to resort to prop drilling. 
- React **hooks** allow us to do a bunch of things inside functional components that we normally would only be able to do inside Class components.
- Together, these two things make it easy to use shared data in aour application, without the use of Redux (no need for a 3rd party library).
