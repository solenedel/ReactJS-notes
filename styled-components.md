# Styled components

1. Delete any css files that were generated by `create-react-app`
2. Install the package: `npm i --save styled-components`

NOTE: recommended to install the VScode extension: vscode-styled-comoponents. 

## How does styled components work?

Without this library, we would create a Component.css file for every Component we need to style.

Import the library: `import styled from 'styled-components`

The styled object is an identifier for the HTML element we want to style. If we want to style a button:

```
export const Button = styled.button`
  width: 200px;
  background-color: red;
`
```

All of the styling is placed between two backticks. We export the Button component so we can use them in other files. Then import the component in other files:
`import { Button } from './components/Button.js'`


Let's say we want 3 buttons: red, green and blue. The height and width is the same for all 3, only the colour changes. Instead of copy pasting the code snipper above and changing the colour, we can do it in a more modular way. 

We can accept props inside the button styles, for the background colour.
```
export const Button = styled.button`
  width: 200px;
  background-color: ${(props) => props.backgroundColor};
`
```

To pass in the props in the parent component of Button: 
```
<div className="App">
  <Button backgroundColor="red">red button</Button>
  <Button backgroundColor="blue">blue button</Button>
</div>
```


When using styled components, almost every HTML element will have to be a component if we want to style it- even invisible div tags. 

If we want to create a container for the buttons in App.js, we can create a file called `container.style.js` and style it: 

```
export const AppContainer = styled.div`
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
`
```

In App.js, we can replace the div with a className of "App" with the styled AppContainer:
```
<AppContainer>
  <Button backgroundColor="red">red button</Button>
  <Button backgroundColor="blue">blue button</Button>
</AppContainer>
```
