# Validations in React

In React, form validation allows the error message to be displayed in our application in the case when the user did not fill out the form correctly with the type of input expected from them. 

**Formik** is basically the most popular library in React for the building and managing of React forms.

There are also advantages to making your own custom client-side form validations. You can create a custom hook that you can use to validate all of your forms.
