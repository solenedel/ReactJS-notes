- JSX is a shorthand way of writing out a tree of HTML elements.
- React uses JSX and react elements to conrtsuct a virtual DOM. 
- the DOM is the underlying tree of HTML elements that make up a page.
- For react to upate the real DOM, it has to build a new virtual DOM, compare it to the old virtual DOM, and update only the elements that have changed in the actual DOM. 

- React is a declarative UI framework: meaning there is a layer of abstraction between what the you code in JavaScript, and what is output to the DOM.
